Developing a mobile application to allow researchers to analyze the memory retention of senior citizens participating in their study. 

The app will be used by each participant for 3 consecutive days. The patients will be able to schedule and record multiple "episodes" during their day, and then the next day will be asked to describe episodes from the previous day. On the last day, they will not record episodes. 

The goal of this project is to create an MVP over Dec 2020 - Jan 2021 that can be used by researchers.
